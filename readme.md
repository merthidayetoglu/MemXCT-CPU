# SC20 SCC Reproducibility Challenge Datasets 

We provide two datasets for the SC20 Student Cluset Competetion over Box. These can be downloaded from (Total of ~90GB): 
[BoxFolder](https://uofi.box.com/s/atdm8zr9qljp53fbiwsrtfoqpbc1a36y)

After download is complete, untar all the files present inside the dataset. 

## Option 2
Automatic download and compilation (requires gzip and tar support).
Space Required: ~200GB. Post processing ~90GB. 

We assume you have set PROJREPO environment variable to the repo home. 

```
git clone https://github.com/merthidayetoglu/SpDNN_Challenge2020.git
cd SpDNN_Challenge2020
export PROJREPO=$PWD
mkdir dataset
cd dataset
bash $PROJREPO/utils/download.sh
```

2. g++ compiler 

## Installing mpicxx compiler - Ignore if single GPU.
```

# For Ubuntu system
sudo apt-get install -y mpich

`export` the installed mpich binary path and lib paths to `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variables. 

# Run 
After clearing dependencies and setting PROJREPO environment variable, run the following.
